I’m Jon — in 30s, tech guy by trade, creator by nature. I’ve been in IT for 15 years, got a degree in Computer Systems, and I’m always spinning up side projects because… well, the economy’s wild enough said.

I have been with my ride-or-die for 13 years (she’s a real one and a stone cold fox), we made two awesome kids, and share a constant itch to go and see new places — especially outside the U.S.

This blog? It’s where I get to breathe a little. Life’s full of pressure — deadlines, deliverables, and grown-up stuff. But here, I get to just be me. No filters. No meetings. Just cool places, real moments, and whatever comes up along the way.

Lightning round! 
- hip-hop, classic rock, indie, folk. 
- Anime (to many to name), 80s/90s action flicks, docs
- baseball, basketball, climbing
